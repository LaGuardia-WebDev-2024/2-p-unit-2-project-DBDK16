        <p>Now I was gonn write a paragraph about whataver and how it can be used and like how it is useful, but honestly like whatever </p>

        <p>Alright its been 5 days since I last touched this project. Its time to lock tf (the Frick) in </p>
<p id="life">Life is wonderful. It really is. I found mysef worrying this morning, only to reflect on my weekend and realize how special my life really is and how much peace of mind I should allow myself to have due to how I get to live. Count all your blessings. Family, friends, even if its at a rough point, relationshipwise; it heals with time. Aslong as you allow yourself to be the fullest, bravest, most selflessly loving version of yourself. You will find the peace of mind you are longing for. Its not just a bunch of cliches mashed together too, its hard to accept some times, but you are a blessing to people! When you just do the simple task of being yourself, that in of itself is a light to the people around you. So nextime your feeling down, like giving up, or that life is just "Whatever", know that being you is enough even if it doesnt feel enough.</p>

<p>alright enough</p>
